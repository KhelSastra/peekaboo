            Like you've read in the book, Haridwar along with Ujjain, Nashik and
            Prayagraj (Allahabad) is one of four sites where drops of Amrit, the
            elixir of immortality accidentally spilled over from the pitcher while
            being carried by the celestial bird Garuda.

            Centuries ago, when Hindus visited the holy town of Haridwar, they
            used to go to the Pandit in charge of one's family register and update
            the family tree with details of all marriages, births, and deaths from
            ones extended joint family.

            honoured by people like me.

            I prefer, as do most Pandas, for people to come prepared after getting
